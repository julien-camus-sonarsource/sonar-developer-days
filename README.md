## 🔍 SonarQube for IDE in Action

### **Before (Step 6): Code with Issues** ⚠️
```javascript
// Memory leak - interval never cleared
setInterval(function() { ... }, 20);

// Deprecated variable declarations  
for (var i = 0; i < obstacles.length; i++) { ... }

// Magic numbers everywhere
if (whale.y > 600 || whale.x < 0) { ... }

// No debugging information
function gameOver() {
    gameRunning = false;
}
```

### **After (Step 7): Clean Professional Code** ✅
```javascript
// Proper resource management
const gameLoop = setInterval(function() { ... }, 20);
function cleanup() { clearInterval(gameLoop); }

// Modern JavaScript
for (const obstacle of obstacles) { ... }

// Named constants
const CANVAS_HEIGHT = 600;
if (whale.y > CANVAS_HEIGHT) { ... }

// Comprehensive logging
function gameOver() {
    console.log('Game Over - Score:', score, 'Position:', whale.x, whale.y);
    gameRunning = false;
}
```

**SonarQube for IDE detects 13+ issues instantly and guides you to fix them!**
